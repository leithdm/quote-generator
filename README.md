# quote-generator

A simple quote generator using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.

1. Makes an asynchronous fetch request to a REST API (http://api.forismatic.com).
2. CORS error can be circumvented by proxy API (not performed in this version)
3. Mobile responsive. Font-Awesome icons, Google Fonts, background image by: http://www.heropatterns.com/

## Issues:
1. The free API (http://api.forismatic.com) gets overloaded with requests, preventing quotes from being returned. Net result is a blank quote.
